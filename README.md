URL for site on render: https://the-natural-path.onrender.com

My Django project for UCD for naturopathic doctors to post their practices for users to find them.

Project Brief: 
1. Who is this site for: 
This site is for people looking for a validated medical methout outside of conventional Western medicine that also understands and employs Western medical practices among many other medical modalities. 

Purpose: 
2. The purpose of this project is to help users connect with naturopaths and NDs. NDs will be able to register their practices, and users of the site will be able to search for a practitioner in their area.

Key Sections: 
3. 

Home page: 
The homepage allows users to find naturopaths and NDs. It gives a bit of background on the purpose of the page, and defines what a naturopath is. From here, naturopaths and NDs can register their practicesa and loging, and users can search the registry of practitioners. 

Register page: 
Here is where practitioners register. 

Login page: 
Here is where practioners login to manage their accounts.

Success page: 
This page is viewed after a practioner has successfully registered. 

Deleted page: 
This page appears when a practioner has successfully deleted their practice or account. 

Providers: 
This page displays all registered practioners. 

Design:
The design was supposed to be simple, clean, and clinical with no frills. Later iterations would have some photos, and a bit more information about the different sercies that naturopaths can offer. Colours are simple, and change in response to screen size.

Navigation:
Navigating the page is simple. Unlike my previous project that used an intuitive navigation style (which I am a huge fan of), this site uses a traditional navigation system that users are used to. Again, dellivering a simple and clean user experience.
